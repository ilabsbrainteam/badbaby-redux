# This file is used both by check-dev-head-t.py and bidsify.py.
# It allows kwargs to be passed to the refit_hpi function, and determines
# which files are actually refit during bidsification. The mapping is:
#
# Filename:
#  refit: bool (whether or not to refit in the bidsify.py script)
#  kwarg: value (passed to refit_hpi function)
#
# Existing reports can be examine with for example in reports/2025-05-06:
# (opens 10 at once):
#
#     $ count=0; for HTML in *.html; do count=$(($count+1)); echo $HTML; google-chrome "file://$PWD/${HTML}#Sensor_alignment"; if (( $count % 10 == 0 )); then read; fi; done
#

# Original flipped
bad_106_am_raw.fif:
  refit: true
bad_106_mmn_raw.fif:
  refit: true
bad_126a_mmn_raw.fif:  # original flipped, and matches am now (pointed a bit up and right)
  refit: true
bad_130b_mmn_raw.fif:  # original flipped and collides with helmet (thus missing source alignment in report)
  refit: true

# None of these are big differences, but our errors are lower and the tilt is more consistent
bad_134a_am_raw.fif:
  refit: true
